This is where the git submodule NuTufts/edep-sim will be built and installed.

To build it:

* go back to the top-level directory
* run `source setenv_py3.sh` to make sure environment variables used to build exists
* run `source build_edep_sim.sh` to build

The script should install the code into EDepSim.
